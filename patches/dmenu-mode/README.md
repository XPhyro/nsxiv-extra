# dmenu-mode

This patch adds <kbd>Shift+Enter</kbd> keybinding which will print the current
filename to stdout and exit.

It also adds `-O` flag which will print the filename of an image as soon as
it's marked. Note that images cannot be unmarked in this mode. Reverse marking
(<kbd>Ctrl\-m</kbd>) is also disabled.

Note: you can use `git am -i <patch>` to interactively pick which patch to
apply.
